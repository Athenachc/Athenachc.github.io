My passion lies in robotics, and I am dedicated to exploring and researching new technologies in this field. 

I am an MPhil graduate specializing in unmanned aerial systems and soft robotics at <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>. I am affiliated with the <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/researchgrp/cywen/index.php/en/index.html">High-speed Thermo-fluid and MAV/UAV Laboratory</a>
